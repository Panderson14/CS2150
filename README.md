# CS2150

This class featured the C++ programming language, which happened to be my favorite programming language thus far. After having liked the C programming language for its simplicity and its uncompromising nature towards any ambiguity, C++ was only a step up.

Granted, a lot of these labs were quite difficult compared to the last semester. However this class definitely made me feel like I had begun to program what would become very important for any future career. We learned several data structures, the complexity of pointers, the UNIX environment, and more.
